Arcticons is a line-based icon pack with over <b>5000 icons!</b> Originally forked from Frost, but rebuild with consistent sizing and adjustments specifically for lines in mind. Arcticons is FOSS and provides icons for almost all open-source apps on F-Droid. Besides that, there are many other apps in there too.

With a design language that's simple and clean, it gives the user a home screen that's less distracting for them. 

If you're missing icons, you can submit an icon request or create it yourself on GitHub!
