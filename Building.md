# Building the app

1. Place the created icons in the `/other` folder and add the new lines of code in the appfilter.xml, you can gather it with [icon request](https://github.com/Kaiserdragon2/IconRequest/releases/).
2. Run the `raster.sh` script and wait until it's done.
3. Change the version code and version name in the app's `build.gradle` file.
4. Open Android studio, plug your phone in (allow USB debugging), choose your build flavor and click the green play button to run it on your phone.
5. You can also generate an APK file in Android studio, more on that [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/)
