# Arcticons privacy policy

**By default, Arcticons doesn't collect any information.** The app is fully usable without internet connection.

However, when you request an icon, by default some data is gathered when you send the request. 
You can modify what you send in the email:

- The email address which you send the request with.
- The manufacturer, the model, product name, screen resolution, and Android version of your phone.- 
- App version & Candybar version (the app dashboard).
- Installed apps that you want icons of.

This information is solely used for the icon request and remains private. **You're also fully controlling what data you send to us via email.**

All mails are securely stored with zero-access encryption via Proton Mail's servers.

The icon request will be made public, but all identifiable information is stripped before it gets to be an issue on GitHub. At the end only the date of the request, app version, Candybar version and the requested apps will be visible in the GitHub issue.
